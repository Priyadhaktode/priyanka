Virat Kohli (Hindi pronunciation: [ʋɪˈɾɑːʈ ˈkoːɦli] (listen); born 5 November 1988) is an Indian international cricketer and former captain of the India national team who plays as a right-handed batsman for Royal Challengers Bangalore in the IPL and for Delhi in Indian domestic cricket. Widely regarded as one of the greatest batsmen of all time,[3] Kohli holds the records for scoring most runs in T20 internationals and in the IPL. In 2020, the International Cricket Council named him the male cricketer of the decade. Kohli has also contributed to India's successes, including winning the 2011 World Cup and the 2013 Champions trophy.

Born and raised in New Delhi, Kohli trained in West Delhi Cricket Academy; started his youth career with Delhi Under-15 team. Kohli made his international debut in 2008 and quickly became a key player in the ODI team. He made his Test debut in 2011. In 2013, Kohli reached the number one spot in the ICC rankings for ODI batsmen for the first time. During 2014 T20 World Cup, he set a record for the most runs scored in the tournament. In 2018, he achieved yet another milestone, becoming the world's top-ranked Test batsman, making him the only Indian cricketer to hold the number one spot in all three formats of the game. His form continued in 2019, where he became the first player to score 20,000 international runs in single decade. In 2021, Kohli made the decision to step down as the captain of the Indian national team for T20Is, following the T20 World Cup and in early 2022 he stepped down as the captain of the Test team as well.

Kohli has received many accolades for his performances on the cricket field. He was recognized as the ICC ODI Player of the Year in 2012 and has won Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy, given to the ICC Cricketer of the Year, on two occasions, in 2017 and 2018. Kohli also won ICC Test Player of the Year and ICC ODI Player of the Year awards in 2018, becoming the first player to win both awards in the same year. Additionally, Kohli was named the Wisden Leading Cricketer in the World for three consecutive years, from 2016 to 2018. At the national level, Kohli was honoured with the Arjuna Award in 2013, the Padma Shri under the sports category in 2017 and the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna award, India's highest sporting honour, in 2018.

In 2016, he was ranked as one of the world's most famous athletes by ESPN and one of the most valuable athlete brands by Forbes. In 2018, Time magazine included him on its list of the 100 most influential people in the world. In 2020, he was ranked 66th in Forbes list of the top 100 highest-paid athletes in the world for the year 2020 with estimated earnings of over $26 million. Kohli has been deemed one of the most commercially viable cricketers, with estimated earnings of ₹165 crore (US$21 million) in the year 2022.
Early life

Virat Kohli was born on 5 November 1988 in Delhi to a Punjabi Hindu family. His father, Prem Kohli, worked as a criminal lawyer and his mother, Saroj Kohli, served as a housewife. He has an older brother, Vikas, and an older sister, Bhawna.[4] Kohli's formative years were spent in the Uttam Nagar and commenced his early education at Vishal Bharti Public School.[5] According to his family, Kohli exhibited an early affinity for cricket as a mere three-year-old. He would pick up a cricket bat, display natural skill, and request his father to bowl to him.[6]

In 1998, the West Delhi Cricket Academy (WCDA) was created and on 30 May of that year, Prem Kohli, espoused his younger son's fervor for cricket, assisted nine-year-old Kohli's aspirations and arranged for him to meet Rajkumar Sharma, who initially perceived him to be just another enthusiastic and determined young boy. However, two weeks later, Sharma was impressed by Kohli's accuracy and power in throwing.[7] Upon the suggestion of their neighbours, Kohli's father considered enrolling his son in a professional cricket academy, as they believed that his cricketing abilities merited more than just playing in the gully cricket.[8] Despite his abilities, he faced the setback of being unable to secure a place in the under-14 Delhi team, not due to a lack of merit but due to extraneous factors. Prem Kohli received offers to relocate his son to influential clubs, which would have ensured his selection, but he declined the proposals, as he was determined that Kohli should earn his recognition based on his own merit and overcome the system of nepotism and deceit prevalent in the Delhi and District Cricket Association (DDCA). Kohli persisted and eventually found his way into the under-15 Delhi team.[9] He received training at the academy while simultaneously participating in matches at the Sumeet Dogra Academy located at Vasundhara Enclave.[10] As per Sharma's recollection of Kohli's initial days at his academy, he exuded remarkable talent, making it arduous for the coach to curb his enthusiasm. Kohli remained prepared to bat at any position, and often, Sharma had to physically coerce him to leave the training sessions, as he was reluctant to depart.[11] In pursuit of furthering his cricketing career, he transitioned to Saviour Convent School during his ninth-grade education.[8] Kohli's ardent passion for cricket compelled him to travel long distances with his father to ensure that he never missed a match. With time, he diligently honed his skills and diversified his range of shots, commanding respect from the local bowlers.[12]

On the 19th of December 2006, Kohli experienced the loss of his father due to a cerebral attack.[8][13] During his childhood, his father played a crucial role in supporting his cricket training. Kohli has credited his father as the one who drove him to practice every day. He has expressed his feelings of missing his father's presence at times.[5][14] Following the demise of Kohli's father, his mother observed a significant change in his personality. Kohli appeared to become more mature overnight, and he began taking every cricket match seriously. He harbored an aversion to exclusion from games and appeared to channel his entire existence into the pursuit of cricket following his father's untimely demise.[8] Kohli's family resided in Meera Bagh, Paschim Vihar until the year 2015, after which they relocated to Gurgaon.[15]
Youth and domestic career
Delhi

Kohli's junior cricket career kicked off in October 2002 at the Luhnu cricket ground in a Polly Umrigar match against the host state of Himachal Pradesh. In his debut match, Kohli managed to score a total of fifteen runs. His first half-century in national cricket came at Ferozeshah Kotla, where he scored 70 runs against Harayana.[16] By the end of the season, Kohli had amassed a total of 172 runs, emerging as the highest run-scorer for his side with an average of 34.40.[17] During the 2003-04 season, Kohli was appointed as the captain of the under-15 team. In his first match of the season, he scored 54 runs in Delhi's victory over Himachal Pradesh. In the next fixture against Jammu and Kashmir, Kohli scored his maiden century with a score of 119 in a BCCI-conducted game. By the end of the season, he had amassed a total of 390 runs at an average of 78, which included two centuries.[18][19][a] Towards the end of 2004, Kohli earned selection for the 2004-05 Vijay Merchant Trophy with the Delhi under-17 team. In the four matches that he played, Kohli accumulated a total of 470 runs, with his highest score being 251* runs. The team's coach, Ajit Chaudhary, lauded his performance and was particularly impressed with his temperament on the field.[21][22] In the 2005-06 season, Kohli commenced his innings with a score of 227 against Punjab. Following their victory over Uttar Pradesh in the quarter-finals, Delhi was scheduled to play against Baroda in the semi-finals. The team had high expectations from Kohli, who had promised his coach to finish the job. True to his word, Kohli went on to score 228 runs, leading Delhi to victory. The team later secured the tournament with a five-wicket win over Mumbai, where he contributed with a half-century in the first innings.[23] He ended as the highest run-scorer with a total of 757 runs from 7 matches, averaging 84.11.[24]

On the 18th of February, 2006, Kohli made his debut in List A cricket, playing against Services in the Ranji One-Day Tophy, but he did not have the opportunity to bat during the match.[25] In 2006, Kohli had garnered enough attention to earn a spot in the state senior team. Subsequently, he made his first-class debut on the 23rd of November, 2006, during the opening match of the Ranji Trophy season against Tamil Nadu. However, his debut innings was a brief one, as he was dismissed after scoring ten runs.[26] In a sequence of three matches, Kohli failed to score a fifty, leading his coaches to provide him with counselling. In the subsequent match against former champions, Karnataka, Delhi found themselves trailing with a score of 130/5, with Kohli remaining unbeaten on 40 at the end of the day's play. Unfortunately, that very night, Kohli's father passed away at 3:54 a.m. Despite the heart-wrenching news, Kohli returned to the match and continued to bat and scored 90 runs before he was dismissed.[27] The team's coach, Chetan Chauhan was impressed by Kohli's resolute determination and unwavering attitude in the face of adversity. Venkatesh Prasad also lauded his crucial knock, which was executed in the midst of an emotional upheaval.[28] Following his dismissal, Kohli immediately attended his father's funeral. His innings, however, proved to be crucial for Delhi as they were able to avoid the follow-on. The team's captain, Mithun Manhas, praised Kohli for his performance, acknowledging its pivotal role in the team's success.[28]

Kohli's foray into T20 cricket took place in April 2007, during the Inter-State T20 Championship, where he emerged as the top run-getter for his team with a tally of 179 runs at an average of 35.80.[29] In September 2008, Kohli played in Nissar Trophy against SNGPL (reigning champions of the of Quaid-i-Azam Trophy from Pakistan). He emerged as the leading scorer for Delhi in both innings, registering 52 runs in the first innings and a towering 197 in the second. The match ultimately ended in a draw, SNGPL being declared the victors due to their lead in first innings.[30] In the 2009-10 Ranji Trophy season, Kohli returned to domestic cricket. During a match against Maharastra, he opened the batting and scored 67 runs, helping Delhi to secure the bonus point required for victory.[31] Kohli's performance reinvigorated the competitive spirit of the domestic cricket circuit. Ashish Nehra observed his growth over time and shared his thoughts:[32]

    I did not see him waste his time. If not on the field, he would be busy in the gym. I saw him first as a chubby-cheeked bubbly young kid who grew into a perfect athlete. His junior cricket lessons have obviously helped him. I did not now him well, but had heard a lot about his exploits in junior cricket.

India Under-19

In July 2006, Kohli was selected in the India Under-19 squad on its tour of England. He averaged 105 in the three-match ODI series against England Under-19s,[33] while also averaging 49 in the three-match Test series.[34] Following India Under-19's success in both the ODI and Test series, the team's coach Lalchand Rajput noted Kohli's adeptness in facing both pace and spin bowling and expressed his admiration for profound technical prowess.[35] In September, the India Under-19 team toured Pakistan. In the first Test match, Kohli scored 63 and 28 as India won by 271 runs against Pakistan Under-19s. In the second match, he contributed 83 runs to India's victory by 240 runs and an innings. He concluded the tour with 80 runs in the final ODI game at Lahore.[36] In early 2007, Kohli was a part of the India Under-19 team that toured New Zealand, where he scored 113 in the first Test match. The series ended in a draw with a 1-1 scoreline. In the following month, the team travelled to Malaysia for a tri-series against England Under-19s and Sri Lanka Under-19s, where Kohli didn't get many opportunities to bat. In July–August, India Under-19 embarked on a tour for a tri-series against Sri Lanka Under-19s and Bangladesh Under-19s, where he didn't score a half-century in any of the matches. However, he made a comeback with scores of 144 and an unbeaten 94 in the following Test series.[37]

In February–March 2008, Kohli assumed the captaincy of the Indian squad that went on to triumph at the 2008 Under-19 Cricket World Cup held in Malaysia. He demonstrated his competence as a batsman, amassing 235 runs in 6 games at an average of 47, ranking as the tournament's third-highest scorer and one of three cricketers to compile a century.[38] His century, a knock of 100 runs off 74 balls, versus the West Indies Under-19s in a group stage encounter, was lauded by ESPNcricinfo, as "the innings of the tournament." This innings paved the way for India's 50-run triumph and fetched Kohli the man of the match award.[39] Additionally, Kohli's all-round performance in the semi-final against New Zealand Under-19s, where he captured 2 wickets and contributed 43 runs in the run-chase, was significant to India's 3-wicket victory.[40] In the championship match, Kohli managed a modest score of 19 against South Africa Under-19s, his contribution lead to India's eventual 12-run win (via D/L method).[41]

In June of the year 2008, Kohli and his Under-19 teammates Pradeep Sangwan and Tanmay Srivastava were awarded the Border-Gavaskar scholarship. This scholarship, aimed at honing the skills of the chosen cricketers, provided an opportunity to train for six weeks at Cricket Australia's Centre of Excellence in Brisbane.[42] In a bid to identify potential talent for the senior team, Kohli was selected to represent India Emerging Players in the Emerging Players Tournament of 2008. Notably, his finest performance in the tournament was against New Zealand Emerging Players, where he played a knock of 120 runs, leading India to a seven-wicket victory. With an aggregate of 204 runs, Kohli's performances did not go unnoticed by the national selectors who were observing his progress. With twenty-eight under-19 ODIs and twelve under-19 Tests, he embarked on his journey to international cricket by joining the senior team on their flight to Colombo.[43]
International career
2008–2009: Debut and maiden stint

In August 2008, Kohli was selected for inclusion in the ODl squad for the tour of Sri Lanka and the Champions Trophy in Pakistan. Prior to the Sri Lankan tour, Kohli had limited experience, with only eight List A matches under his belt.[44] So, his selection was considered a "surprise call-up".[45] During the Sri Lankan tour, as both first-choice openers Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag, were unable to play due to injury, Kohli was required to fill the role of makeshift opener throughout the series.[46] On 18 August 2008, Kohli made his international debut at the age of 19 in the first ODI of the tour, where he was dismissed for 12 runs, caught dead in front by an incutter from Nuwan Kulasekara.[47] However, in the fourth match of the series, Kohli achieved his inaugural half century in the ODl format, with a total of fifty-four runs scored.[48]

Following the postponement of the Champions Trophy to 2009, Kohli was picked as a replacement for the injured Shikhar Dhawan in the India A squad for the unofficial Tests against Australia A in September 2008.[49] Despite limited opportunities, he managed to make an impact in the single innings that he participated in, scoring 49 runs.[50] In October 2008, Kohli participated in a four-day tour match against Australia as part of the Indian Board President's XI team. The match featured a formidable Australian bowling line-up that consisted of Brett Lee, Stuart Clark, Mitchell Johnson, Peter Siddle and Jason Krejza. Despite this, Kohli displayed his batting prowess by scoring 105 runs in the first innings and an unbeaten 16 runs in the second innings, demonstrating his ability to perform against high-level international competition.[51]

In November 2008, Kohli was selected for inclusion in the squad for the home ODI series against England, due to the presence of established and experienced players such as Tendulkar and Sehwag, he was not given an opportunity to play in any of the matches.[52] In December 2008, Kohli was awarded a Grade D contract by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) as part of the annual contract list for the Indian national team which entitled him to receive ₹1.5 million (equivalent to ₹3.6 million or US$44,000 in 2020), A certain level of remuneration for representing the national team in various matches and events.[53] Despite being awarded a contract, in January, Kohli was dropped for the five-match ODl series against Sri Lanka in Sri Lanka.[54]

In July–August 2009, Kohli was selected in the four-team Emerging Players Tournament, held in Australia. He was selected to open the innings for the Indian Emerging Players team in the tournament, and he went on to have a standout performance. Kohli finished as the tournament's leading run-scorer, with a total of 398 runs from seven matches, at an average of 66.33. He was particularly impressive in the final match, where he scored 104 runs off 102 balls against the South Africa Emerging Players team in Brisbane. His strong performance helped lead his team to a 17-run victory and the tournament title.[55][56] At the conclusion of the tournament, Kris Srikkanth, the Chairman of the Indian national selection committee, expressed his admiration for Kohli's performance during the tournament. Srikkanth stated,"I must say, opener Virat Kohli was outstanding. Some of the shots he played spoke about his ability."[57] Kohli himself has stated that this tournament was a "turning point" in his career.[58]

In August 2009, Kohli returned to the national team after recovering from a minor shoulder injury, replacing the injured Gautam Gambhir in the Indian squad for the tri-series in Sri Lanka.[59] He was also utilized as a middle order batsman in the 2009 ICC Champions Trophy due to an injury sustained by Yuvraj Singh.[60] In December of that same year, he was included in the team for home ODI series against Sri Lanka and scored 27[61] and 54 in the first two ODIs before making way for Yuvraj, who regained fitness for the third ODI. However, due to the reoccurrence of a finger injury, Yuvraj was ruled out indefinitely,[62] which led to Kohli's return to the team in the fourth ODI at Kolkata. In that match, Kohli scored his maiden ODI century–107 off 114 balls–while sharing a 224-run partnership for the third wicket with Gambhir. As a result of this performance, India won by seven wickets and sealed the series 3–1.[63][b]
2010–2011: Rise through the ranks

In January 2010, Kohli was given the opportunity in tri-nation ODI tournament in Bangladesh, as Tendulkar was rested for the event.[64] During the series, Kohli became just the third Indian player to score two ODI centuries before the age of 22.[65] He was widely hailed for his performances, and ultimately emerged as the leading run-scorer of the series, with 275 runs from five innings at an impressive average of 91.66.[66] Kohli's success on the field belies the stereotype of him as a brash and arrogant player. In fact, Indian captain MS Dhoni has noted that "he has grabbed his chances" and that "he has matured now." Dhoni went on to say that "To us, he comes as a 'humble guy'. He might come across different to the world."[67]

Kohli's initial foray into leadership on an international level occurred in May–June 2010, when he was appointed as vice-captain for the tri-series against Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe in Zimbabwe. This appointment came as many more established players were rested for the tour. However, in the first match, Kohli was dismissed on a diamond duck, a rare and unusual mode of dismissal.[68] Despite this early setback, Kohli managed to become the fastest Indian batsman at the time to reach 1,000 runs in ODI cricket, achieving this milestone in 26 innings.[69] Kohli also made his International T20 debut against Zimbabwe at Harare, where he scored an unbeaten 26.[70] Later that month, during the 2010 Asia Cup, Kohli was included in the Indian team and was given the role of batting at number 3. However, his struggles with form started as he scored a total of 67 runs at an average of 16.75.[71] This poor form was also reflected in the tri-series against Sri Lanka and New Zealand in Sri Lanka where his average was a mere 15.[72]

Despite his recent struggles with form, Kohli was retained in the Indian ODI squad for a three-match series against Australia in October. In the only completed match of the series, held at Visakhapatnam, Kohli scored a century, earning him the man of the match award. He candidly acknowledged that he was under significant pressure to maintain his place in the team, given his previous failures in the preceding series.[73] During the home ODI series against New Zealand, Kohli scored another match-winning century in the first match, marking his fourth ODI hundred and second in succession.[74] The Indian team emerged victorious with a 5–0 whitewash over New Zealand, and Kohli's exceptional performances in the series solidified his position in the ODI team and made him a strong candidate for a spot in India's World Cup squad.[75][76] He was India's leading run-scorer in ODIs in 2010, accumulating 995 runs from 25 matches at an average of 47.38, including three centuries and seven half-centuries.[77]

    "He is a very physical type of player. He likes to impose himself on the game, backs it up with his skill."

 – Team India's coach Dav Whatmore at the 2008 Under-19 World Cup on Kohli, [78]

Kohli was India's leading run scorer in the five-match ODI series of the South African tour in January 2011, with 193 runs including two fifties, both in Indian defeats.[79] During the series, he jumped to number two spot on the ICC Rankings for Men's ODI batters,[80] and was named in India's 15-man squad for the World Cup.[81]

Kohli played in every match of India's successful World Cup campaign. He scored an unbeaten 100 in the first match against Bangladesh and became the first Indian batsman to score a century on World Cup debut.[82] In the final against Sri Lanka at Mumbai, he scored 35, sharing an 83 runs partnership with Gambhir for the third wicket after India had lost both openers within seven overs while chasing 275.[83][84]

Breakthrough in Test cricket

When India toured the West Indies in June–July 2011, they selected a largely inexperienced squad, resting Tendulkar while others such as Gambhir and Sehwag missed out due to injuries. Kohli was one of three uncapped players in the Test squad.[85] Kohli made his Test debut at Kingston in the first match of the Test series that followed. He batted at 5th position and was dismissed on scores of 4 and 15, caught behind off the bowling of Fidel Edwards in both innings.[86] India went on to win the Test series 1–0 but Kohli amassed just 76 runs from five innings,[87] struggling against the short ball.[88]

Initially got dropped from the Test squad for India's four-match series in England in July and August due to poor performance in his debut series. However Kohli was recalled as a replacement for the injured Yuvraj,[89] though he did not get to play in any match of that series. He found moderate success in the subsequent ODI series in which he averaged 38.80.[90] His score of 55 in the first ODI at Chester-le-Street was followed by a string of low scores in the next three matches.[48] In the last game of the series at Cardiff, Kohli scored his sixth ODI hundred–107 runs off 93 balls–and shared 170 runs partnership with Rahul Dravid for the third wicket,[91] who was playing his last ODI match.[92] Kohli was dismissed hit wicket in that innings .It was the only century in the series by any player of either team and earned him praise for his "hard work" and "maturity".[93]

In October 2011, Kohli was the leading run scorer of the five-match home ODI series against England which India won 5–0. He scored a total of 270 runs across five matches at an average of 90. This included unbeaten knock of 112 from 98 balls at Delhi, where he put on an unbroken 209 run partnership with Gambhir;[94] followed by innings of 86 at Mumbai, both the knocks came in successful run chases.[95] Owing to his ODI success, Kohli was included in the Test squad to face the West Indies in November. He was selected in the final match of the series at Mumbai in which he scored a pair of fifties.[96] India won the subsequent ODI series 4–1 in which Kohli managed to accumulate 243 runs at 60.75.[97] During the series, Kohli scored his eighth ODI century and his second at Visakhapatnam, where he made 117 off 123 balls in India's run chase of 270.[98] A knock which raised his reputation as "an expert of the chase".[99] Kohli ended up as the leading run-getter in ODIs for the year 2011, with 1381 runs from 34 matches at 47.62 including four centuries and eight fifties.[100]

During tour of Australia in December 2011, Kohli failed to go past 25 in the first two Tests, as his defensive technique was exposed.[101] While fielding on the boundary during the second day of the second match at Sydney, he gestured to the crowd with his middle finger for which he was fined 50% of his match fee by the match referee.[102] He top scored in each of India's innings in the third Test at Perth with scores of 44 and 75, even as India got their second consecutive innings defeat.[103][104] In the fourth and final match at Adelaide, Kohli scored his maiden Test century, 116 runs in the first innings.[105] India suffered a 0–4 whitewash and Kohli, India's top run-scorer in the series was described as "the lone bright spot in an otherwise nightmare visit for the tourists".[106]
2012–2013: ODI ascendancy and ascension to vice-captaincy

In the first seven matches of the Commonwealth Bank triangular series that India played against hosts Australia and Sri Lanka, Kohli made two fifties–77 at Perth and 66 at Brisbane, both against Sri Lanka.[48] Being set a target of 321 by Sri Lanka, Kohli came to the crease with India's score at 86/2 and went on to score 133 not out from 86 balls to take India to a comfortable win with 13 overs to spare.[107] India earned a bonus point with the win and Kohli was named Man of the Match for his knock.[108] Former Australian cricketer and commentator Dean Jones rated Kohli's innings as "one of the greatest ODI knocks of all time".[109] However, Sri Lanka beat Australia three days later in their last group fixture and knocked India out of the series.[110] With 373 runs at 53.28, Kohli finished as India's highest run-scorer and lone centurion of the series.[111]

The Royal Challengers coach, Ray Jennings praised Kohli, stating that the young man of 22 years held the potential to become the future captain not only of the franchise, but of the Indian national team as well.[314] During the season, Kohli lived up to the expectations and was instrumental in leading his team to the runner-up position. He amassed 557 runs, including four half-centuries, with an average of 46.41, earning the distinction of being the second-highest run-scorer for the season, trailing only teammate Chris Gayle.[315]

This saw him take the 9th place among the tournament's highest run-scorers,[342] his team, Royal Challengers Bangalore, was eliminated in the eliminator match against Sunrisers Hyderabad, with Kohli's early dismissal in the second over at the hands of Jason Holder playing a significant role in their elimination.[343]

Kohli playing his famous flick shot in CWC 2015

Kohli is considered as an enterprising batsman, possessing technical abilities and a dynamic playing demeanor.[351][352] His customarily batting position in ODl cricket is at number three, with a slightly open-chested stance,[353] and a resolute grip on the bottom handle of his bat. He has been noted for his agile footwork, expansive range of strokes, and his propensity for adeptly orchestrating innings whilst thriving in high-pressure situations.[354][355] In his batting technique, Kohli tends to favor playing grounded shots rather than attempting big hits. He is appreciated for his ability to execute wrist shots and his consistent prowess in the mid-wicket and cover region.[356][357]

Kohli has often expressed his admiration for the cover drive, which he considers to be his signature stroke. He possesses a natural aptitude for the flick shot, particularly when facing deliveries aimed towards leg stump.[6] Having a limited recourse to the sweep shot, Kohli's batting technique is characterized by an emphasis on ground shots that primarily yield runs in the regions between deep square leg and mid-on.[358] Kohli is known for his composed batting technique and versatility in his play. He scores runs between long-off and long-on with an aligned bat, while also possessing the ability to display a destructive streak. His combination of bat-speed and supple wrist movements enable him to craft innovative angles that disrupt traditional field positioning.[359] Kohli is also a proficient fielder, recognized for his quick reflexes and sure-handedness.

However, Kohli has a known vulnerability to deliveries that are wide of the off-stump.[360] Bowlers often exploit this weakness by targeting him with such deliveries, especially in Test and ODl matches.[361] This vulnerability has resulted in Kohli's dismissal on numerous occasions.[362][363] Cricket experts such as VVS Laxman and former India cricketer Sanjay Manjrekar have acknowledged this weakness,[364][365] and former New Zealand cricketer Richard Hadlee has also noted that Kohli is particularly susceptible to out-swinging deliveries.[366]

Nevertheless, the cricketer has persistently maintained that his aggression acts as a source of inspiration and drives his focus and motivation on the field.[381] In contrast to certain former Indian cricketers who have exhibited an inclination towards excessive politeness and reticence, Kohli is widely regarded as a self-assured and confident individual who embodies his combative demeanor both on and off the cricket field.[382]
Comparisons to Sachin Tendulkar

Dubbed as Tendulkar's "successor",[383][384] he is widely considered to have the potential to surpass his records in the future.[385][386] His reverence for Tendulkar as a role model, who he idolized in his formative years and sought to emulate, is well-documented. Kohli has stated that he tried to mirror Tendulkar's style of batting, imitating his shots and attempting to hit sixes in a similar manner.[387] Kohli's aggressive and dynamic style has earned him accolades from cricketing greats such as Vivian Richards, who has acknowledged Kohli's similarities to his own playing style.[388] He has been lauded as the "new king of world cricket" by Dean Jones, a former Australian cricketer.[389] While Indian commentator Aakash Chopra has noted that Tendulkar possessed a broader array of shots,[390] Kohli's skills with the bat have earned him accolades from former West Indies great Brian Lara, who has ranked him among the best batsmen in the world alongside Joe Root, the England captain at the time.[391]

In a discourse with the prominent Bollywood actor Salman Khan, Tendulkar proclaimed that Kohli possesses the potential to surpass his record of 100 international centuries. The celebrated batsman, widely deemed as one of the greatest cricketers of all time, acknowledged Kohli's batting aptitudes and the steadfastness with which he has accumulated runs , it is not a far-fetched possibility for him to surpass the landmark set by Tendulkar himself.[392] In 2013, Tendulkar retired from international cricket, marking the end of an era for Indian cricket. Kohli, who played alongside Tendulkar in the team, honoured him by presenting him with a sacred thread that had been gifted to him by his late father.

Driven by his own inclination towards a plant-based diet, Kohli aims to raise awareness and encourage individuals to adopt more sustainable and environmentally conscious practices.[439]
Philanthropy
Virat Kohli at charity dinner for Smile Foundation

In 2013, Kohli established the "Virat Kohli Foundation" with a philanthropic objective to support underprivileged children.[440] The foundation collaborates with a selected group of NGOs to increase awareness and gather support for various causes that are instrumental in advancing their mission of promoting the welfare and well-being of these children.[441][442] In 2014, the foundation participated in a charity auction organized by eBay and Save the Children India, the proceeds of which were directed towards the education and healthcare of underprivileged children.[443] Kohli is dedicated to creating a brighter future for children by implementing sports-based programs and providing them with necessary resources, leveraging his connections and partnerships to uplift marginalized segments of society.[444]

Kohli's foundation has organized several charity events to raise funds for its causes, including football matches featuring prominent Indian cricketers and Bollywood actors. The first such event was a celebrity football match in collaboration with Abhishek Bachchan's charity foundation, which drew significant media attention and was successful in raising funds.[445] In this match, Kohli captained the All Hearts FC against the All Stars FC, led by Abhishek Bachchan.[446] Another charity football match, dubbed the "Celebrity Clasico," was held in June 2016 in Mumbai, with Kohli once again leading the All Hearts FC against the All Stars FC, captained by Ranbir Kapoor. This event was also a major success in generating funds for charitable causes.[447]

In 2016, the Virat Kohli Foundation entered into a partnership with Smile Foundation to promote the empowerment of underprivileged children and young people. To kickstart this initiative, Kohli organized a philanthropic dinner at Hyatt Regency in Mumbai, graced by the presence of cricketing luminaries such as MS Dhoni, Shikhar Dhawan, Yuvraj Singh, Ajinkya Rahane, and KL Rahul to support the cause of child and youth empowerment.[448] To advance the goals of the Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM), which aims at creating a cleaner India, Kohli and the Indian cricket team, in collaboration with Anurag Sharma, undertook a cleaning initiative at the Eden Gardens on the occasion of Gandhi Jayanti of 2016.[449]

Prior to a match against Sri Lanka in 2017 Champions Trophy, Kohli hosted a benevolent gala event in London in support of the Justice and Care organization. The ball was arranged with the objective of increasing both funds and awareness for the humanitarian cause championed by Justice and Care. The organization endeavors to combat the pernicious issues of human trafficking and contemporary slavery.[450] In 2017, Kohli established the Athlete Development Programme (ADP) as a platform for nurturing and supporting aspiring young athletes. This initiative provides comprehensive guidance to these young athletes in areas such as coaching, training, fitness, competition, and nutrition, thereby fostering their growth and development. The program has proven beneficial to several young sports persons, including tennis player Swastika Ghosh and golfer Aadil Bedi.[451]

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020, Kohli and his wife Anushka Sharma pledged donations to the PM Relief Fund and the Maharashtra CM Relief Fund.[452] The couple has a strong passion for animal welfare and have made personal contributions towards wildlife relief efforts. Through his support of Awaaz, Kohli seeks to provide comprehensive medical services, shelter, and sustenance to stray animals.[453]

Notes

During a certain phase in his career, Kohli acquired the moniker Cheeku/Chikoo. One evening, Kohli availed himself of the services of a nearby salon and underwent a makeover. Upon displaying his new appearance to his colleagues, Kohli's assistant coach, Ajit Chowdhary, made a humorous comparison between Kohli's appearance and that of "Chikoo," a character from the popular Indian comic book, Champak.[20]
In recognition of this achievement, Gautam Gambhir, who scored 150 not out in the match and received the player of the match award, graciously passed on the award to Kohli.
Kohli is behind Sachin Tendulkar (100) in the all-time list. He did so in 664 innings

    He is even the second fastest to 5000,6000 and 7000 runs after Hashim Amla
