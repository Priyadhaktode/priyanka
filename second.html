Testimonial

    People refer to their college as Alma matter which is Latin word that means, "Generous mother". There is no other way that I would like to remember Amrutvahini College of Engineering. Like a mother this college has nurtured my talents, quenched our thirst for knowledge. This college turned my mirrors into windows. It was always way ahead of its time. This college has helped me build a very strong foundation of ethics. Most of all, the school provided me memories and friends worth cherishing all my life and for this I shall be thankful to my college forever Mr. Devendra Mishra, County Head -India, Novenco Building and Industry BE Mech(1999)
    Dear Dr. Venkatesh (Principal), I wish to place my sincere appreciation to the Students and Faculty of AVCOE who have kept their time and knowledge in making TIFAN-2018 prize. I have seen the Vehicle during my recent visit to your Institute. It was really fantastic and even I had in my mind that they are having bring chances of winning the TROPHY. Best wishes to one and all. I will be happy to help the students and faculty (particularly Mechanical and Production) for any R&D activity. Looking forward. Dr. T V K Gupta, VNIT Nagpur

    Four years of mechanical engineering @Amrutvahini College of engineering was golden era of my life. I joined AVCOE in 1997 with full of dreams. This college converted my dreams into reality. In engineering language, it's factory of converting raw material into finish product. College and all staff members are committed not only technical but also personal development of every student. Proud to be alumina of AVCOE.
